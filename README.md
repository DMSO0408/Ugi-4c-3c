The document "wash_mol_ugi_4c3c.ipynb contains data preprocessing code. The purpose of this code is to generate csv files of primary amines, isocyanides, and keto acids for virtual library construction from the Bide Molecular Building Blocks Database. The main contents include cleaning up invalid SMILES, substructure matching, and selecting pre-experimental molecules through clustering of Morgan molecular fingerprints.
The document "generate_virtual_library_4c3c.ipynb contains code for generating a virtual library. The main content includes obtaining Ugi reaction products through SMARTS concatenation, based on the reaction pattern of 4c-3c-Ugi.
